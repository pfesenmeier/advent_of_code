1. Parse tree
- perhaps more flexible


 [[[[[4,3],4],4],[7,[[8,4],9]]],[1,1]]


 4,3  4 4  
Step 1. Parser

rule digit
rule pair
  '[' + pair() / digit() + ',' + pair() / digit() ']'   

struct Pair {
  lhs: Box<Pair>,
  rhs: Box<Pair>,
}

all snailfish numbers are Pairs
not all pair members are Pairs

struct snailfish_number {
  lhs: Box<Expression>,
  rhs: Box<Expression>,
}

enum Expression {
  Digit,
  Pair(Box<Expression>, Box<Expression>),
}

Pair has two digits
Pair has two Pairs
Pair has one digit and one Pair
